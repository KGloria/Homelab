## Webserver
Node.js, Express
> I decided to try hosting my own version of my React Application on my home server. I learned quite a bit on what it takes to actaully run a webserver. The webserver is not tied to a Domain name due to my ISP only providing static public IP addresses to bussiness accounts, but managed to still have it accessable by searching for the IP and Port (http://XX.XX.XXX.XX:Port).
